<h2>User Guide</h2>
<p><strong><a href="index.html"><span class="green">VTDIRECT95</span></a></strong> has two driver 
subroutines---VTdirect and pVTdirect.  The
subroutine VTdirect is a sequential Fortran 95 implementation of the DIRECT
global unconstrained optimization algorithm for finding the global minimum
of a multivariate function. The subroutine pVTdirect is a massively parallel
version of VTdirect. These two subroutines share the modules REAL_PRECISION
from HOMPACK90 for specifying the real data type; VTDIRECT_GLOBAL containing
definitions of derived data types, parameters, and module procedures;
VTDIRECT_COMMSUB containing the common subroutines and functions; and
VTDIRECT_CHKPT defining data types and module procedures for the
checkpointing feature.  The specific data types, auxiliary subroutines,
and functions for each subroutine are given in the module VTdirect_MOD
(file VTdirect.f95) for VTdirect, or in the module pVTdirect_MOD (file
pVTdirect.f95) for pVTdirect.  In addition, error flags are described in
the comments at the beginning of the driver subroutines VTdirect and
pVTdirect.  These comments serve as the user manual for the package.

<p>
The physical organization into files is as follows. Files are distributed
in a two-level directory structure.  All the source files are at the top
level.  Input data files and sample output files for VTdirect and pVTdirect
are in the directories 'serial' and 'parallel', respectively.  The file
objfunc.f95 defines example objective functions used for testing.  The
file shared_modules.f95 contains the modules REAL_PRECISION, VTDIRECT_GLOBAL,
VTDIRECT_COMMSUB, and VTDIRECT_CHKPT.  The file simple_main.f95 contains
a simple example of a main program that calls VTdirect with hardwired
inputs to optimize the Griewank test function defined in the file
objfunc.f95.  The file sample_main.f95 contains a test program that calls
VTdirect to optimize five test objective functions defined in the file
objfunc.f95 and verifies the installation; the file VTdirect.f95 contains
the module VTdirect_MOD, which includes the driver subroutine VTdirect.
The directory 'serial' contains five namelist files (direct*.nml) to be
used for testing, and a sample output file results.txt generated by the
test program SAMPLE_MAIN.
</p>
<p>
The file sample_pmain.f95 contains the test and verification program for
pVTdirect; the file pVTdirect.f95 contains the module pVTdirect_MOD, which
includes the driver subroutine pVTdirect.  The directory 'parallel' contains
namelist files (pdirect*.nml) with additional parallel scheme parameters,
and an example output file (result*.txt) for each objective function.
</p>
<p>
In the test program, each objective function illustrates a different way
of calling the principal subroutine VTdirect or pVTdirect.  The calls
illustrate four different stopping rules--- maximum number of iterations,
maximum number of function evaluations, minimum box diameter, and minimum
relative decrease in objective function value. For the last objective
function, a multiple best box output is illustrated. Details of the arguments
are in comments at the beginning of the subroutine VTdirect.  Different
parallel schemes are used in the test cases for pVTdirect.  The main test
program prints to standard out the stopping rule satisfied, the minimum
objective function value, the minimum box diameter, and the number of
iterations, function evaluations, and the minimum vector(s). In addition,
the test output for pVTdirect lists the number of masters per subdomain
and the number of subdomains.
</p>
<p>
To test the serial code, compile the files in the following order as in:
</p>
<p>
$f95 -o main $OPTS shared_modules.f95 VTdirect.f95 sample_main.f95
</p>
<p>
where $f95 is the name of the Fortran 95 compiler and $OPTS are compiler
options.  Then execute
</p>
<p>
cd serial; ../main
</p>
<p>
to test the installation.
</p>
<p>
The simple main program example in simple_main.f95 is compiled and
tested similarly.
</p>
<p>
To test the parallel code, compile the files in the following order as in:
</p>
<p>
$f95 -o pmain $OPTS shared_modules.f95 pVTdirect.f95 sample_pmain.f95
</p>
<p>
where $f95 is the name of the Fortran 95 compiler and $OPTS are compiler
options.  (Note: as of August, 2007, the Intel ifort compiler requires the
option "-assume byterecl" for pVTdirect and MPI to work together correctly.)
Then, to test the installation, execute the parallel code 'pmain' from the
current directory 'parallel' using your local parallel job execution script.
You may need to specify suffix options for MPI to pass the compilation.
</p>
<p>
Since the main program SAMPLE_PMAIN tests different parallel
configurations, it is necessary to change the variable 'test_opt' in
sample_pmain.f95 and recompile for each of the five parallel tests.
</p>
<p>
To call VTdirect or pVTdirect from your application, you must provide an
interface block to your objective function similar to those for the five
sample objective functions in sample_main.f95 and sample_pmain.f95.
</p>
<p>
NOTE:  The file pVTdirect.MPI-1.f95 contains an MPI-1 version of the
(updated, MPI-2 based) subroutine pVTdirect contained in the file
pVTdirect.f95.
