<h2>About the Implementation</h2>
<img src="images/direct.jpg" width="132" height="124" alt="direct steps" class="left photo" />
<p>The design issues addressed in <strong><a href="index.html"><span class="green">VTDIRECT95</span></a></strong>
include algorithm modifications, data structures, parallel schemes, and error handling. 
Advanced features (derived data types, pointers, dynamic memory allocation, etc.) supplied by 
FORTRAN 95 were used to design dynamic data structures that flexibly organize the data on a 
single machine, effectively reduce the local data storage, and efficiently share the data 
across multiple processors. Moreover, a multilevel functional and data parallelism is 
proposed to produce multiple starting points, mitigate the data dependency, and improve 
the load balancing. In addition, both the serial and parallel programs are equipped with 
checkpointing features to provide fault tolerance to power outage or hardware/memory failures,
and enable hot restarts for large runs.
</p>

<p><strong><span class="green">Algorithm Modifications:</span></strong> DIRECT's behavior in 
multiple dimensions can be viewed as taking steps in potentially optimal directions within the entire 
design space. The potentially optimal directions are determined through evaluating the objective function 
at center points of the subdivided regions. The search is carried out through three essential operations: 
region selection (SELECTION), point sampling (SAMPLING), and space division (DIVISION). A few 
modifications were made in VTDIRECT95 to meet the needs of various applications and improve the 
performance on large scale parallel systems <a href="pub.html#p13">[13]</a>
<a href="pub.html#p14">[14]</a>.</p>

<p><strong><span class="green">Data Structures:</span></strong> 
One of the biggest design challenges of DIRECT is to break the "curse of dimensionality" first noted by its creators. The approach here is to design dynamic data structures
that are easily extensible to store continuously generated data from point sampling/space
division and to share the data storage among multiple processors. The original design of
the data structures is reported in <a href="pub.html#p2">[2]</a> and <a href="pub.html#p13">[13]</a>, 
documented for the serial implementation previously named as VTDIRECT. The design used in VTDIRECT95 
has been improved by adopting a min-heap data structure and a memory reduction technique 
<a href="pub.html#p1">[1]</a><a href="pub.html#p14">[14]</a>.

<p><strong><span class="green">Parallel Schemes:</span></strong> The functional flow of DIRECT 
exposes its inherent sequential nature. The data dependency among the algorithm steps 
suggests a multilevel parallelism for SELECTION and SAMPLING. The parallel scheme for SELECTION 
concentrates on distributing data among multiple masters to share the memory burden. 
The data-distributed scheme naturally parallelizes the convex hull computation by merging 
multiple local convex hulls to a global one. Differently for SAMPLING, a functional parallelism 
distributes function evaluation tasks to workers. Nevertheless, function evaluations should be 
computed locally on masters if the evaluation cost is cheaper than the communication round 
trip cost. This is called the "horizontal scheme" (multiple masters without workers) to 
contrast with the "vertical scheme" (one master and multiple workers) <a href="pub.html#p10">[10]</a>. </p>

<p><strong><span class="green">Error Handling:</span></strong> Program robustness requires error 
handling that anticipates, detects, and resolves errors at run time. The highest level of error 
handling capability is fault tolerance that attempts to recover from hardware or operating system 
failures if possible, and if not, terminates the program gracefully. The tradeoff for fault tolerance 
is increased program complexity. The errors encountered in VTDIRECT95 come from several sources, 
including input parameters, memory allocation, files, MPI library, and hardware/power failure, etc. 
The error handling strategies here aim at balancing potential computation loss with implementation 
complexity. Therefore, simple fault tolerance features are considered only for recovering from 
some of the input parameter errors. The remaining errors are regarded as fatal errors, which are
handled by checkpointing to save the computation as much as possible for later recovery
