<h2>About the Authors</h2>
<p><strong><span class="green">Jian He</span></strong> earned a bachelor degree in computer engineering in July
1996 from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China.
After that, she worked for three years at METSTAR Meteorological Radar
System Company, a joint venture by Lockheed Martin Corporation and China
Meteorological Administration in Beijing, China. In August 2000, she began
graduate study in computer science at Virginia Tech, and defended her Ph.D.
work in the area of parallel global optimization in 2007. During her
graduate studies, Jian did a summer internship in the Advanced Computations
Department at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, where she worked on
dynamic flux balance analysis of metabolic networks. Jian won Outstanding
Graduate Research Awards for both her master's and doctoral work at Virginia
Tech.</p>

<p><a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/~ltw/shortvita.html">Layne T. Watson</a> 
received the B.A. degree (magna cum laude) in
psychology and mathematics from the University of Evansville, Indiana, in
1969, and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor, in 1974. He is a professor of computer science and mathematics
at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. His research
interests include fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, numerical analysis,
optimization, parallel computation, mathematical software, image processing,
and bioinformatics.  He has worked for USNAD Crane, Sandia National
Laboratories, and General Motors Research Laboratories and served on the
faculties of the University of Michigan and Michigan State University,
East Lansing, before coming to Virginia Tech. His professional service
includes stints as associate editor of ORSA Journal on Computing, SIAM
Journal on Optimization, Computational Optimization and Applications,
Evolutionary Optimization, Engineering Computations, and the International
Journal of High Performance Computing Applications. He has published well
over 250 refereed journal articles and 150 refereed conference papers.  He
is a fellow of the IEEE, the National Institute of Aerospace, and the
International Society of Intelligent Biological Medicine.
